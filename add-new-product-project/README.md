#Adding a New Product in the Database.
## DESCRIPTION

## Project objective:

Create a servlet-based web application that shows a form to add new products. A MySQL database will be created to store product data. The form data will be validated, and a row will be added to the database. All database processing will be done using Hibernate.


## Background of the problem statement:

As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, you have to create a database table for storing product information. A form is needed to add new products. The form submission is validated, and a new record is created in the product table.


### You must use the following:

 *     Eclipse as the IDE
 *     Apache Tomcat as the web server
 *     JSP pages for the front end
 *     Servlets for backend processing
 *     Hibernate to store data into the database


### Following requirements should be met:

 *     Show an add product form in JSP
 *     Handle the form submission in a servlet. Validate it for any missing information
 *     Add the product information into the database using Hibernate
 *     Set up Hibernate configuration files using XML for the product table
 *     A class has to be created to store product data. This class will be linked to Hibernate via an hbm.xml file
 *     The servlet will put the form data into the product class and then pass the product class into Hibernate to add into the database
 *     The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented
